     !-- Order matters here. VisibleObject.js has to be called
     !-- before PhysicalObject.js because PhysicalObject.js calls
     !-- a function that is defined in VisibleObject.js, and
     !-- jsProject.js has to be last because it calls functions
     !-- that we're defining in the other files. I'm treating
     !-- these other files the same way you would source files
     !-- in C++ simply because that's what I'm used to.
